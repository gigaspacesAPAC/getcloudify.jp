# Overview

In this tutorial we will create a blueprint([?]({{page.terminology_link}}#blueprint)) that will describe the topology([?]({{page.terminology_link}}#topology)) of the Nodecellar application([?]({{page.terminology_link}}#application)). The Nodecellar application is a Node.js web application of a wine catalog.

The blueprint we will be writing is an exact replica of the blueprint we deployed when we [got started]({{page.getting_started_link}}).

It includes the following components:

**Infrastructure:**

- Two hosts (we will call them nodejs_host and mongodb_host) that contain the application. One contains Node.JS and the other MongoDB. In this tutorial we will use localhost for both host nodes([?]({{page.terminology_link}}#node)) as we want to install the entire application on our Vagrant VM.


**Middleware:**

- [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) - This is a javascript based application server that serves this web application - It is contained within the nodejs_host.

- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) - This is a JSON document store that serves as the application database - It is contained within the mongodb_host.

**Application:**

- Nodecellar - This is the application business logic packed as a Node.JS application. It is hosted within the Node.JS server. It requires a connection to the MongoDB Database.

The topology should look like this:

## Cloudify YAML DSL

Cloudify's Domain Specific Language (DSL) is written in YAML. If you are not familiar with yaml you may want to read the [yaml documentation](http://www.yaml.org/start.html) first.

Each step of the tutorial is tagged on github. To clone it locally do the following:

{%highlight bash%}
git clone https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-nodecellar-singlehost.git
git checkout tags/stepX #step1 to step9 (the latter is identical to the 3.0 version tag)
{%endhighlight%}

# Step by Step Walkthrough

## Step 1: Creating the Blueprint

First lets create a folder with the name `nodecellar` and create a blueprint.yaml file within it. This file is the blueprint file.

Now lets declare the name of this blueprint
{%highlight yaml%}
blueprint:
    name: nodecellar
{%endhighlight%}


Now we can start the topology. The topology is a yaml object called nodes. Its value is a yaml list.
{%highlight yaml%}
blueprint:
    name: nodecellar
    nodes:
{%endhighlight%}



## Step 2: Adding a Host for nodejs

<a href="https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-nodecellar-example/" class="btn btn-default" role="button"><i class="fa fa-search"></i>  Code Diff</a>

Lets add the nodejs_host as the first node in the list of nodes. To do so we need a `type`([?]({{page.terminology_link}}#type)) as each node is an instance of a type.
Types are like classes in an OO program. They represent a type of component in an application at any level: Infrastructure (hosts, networks etc), middleware (application servers, web servers, etc) or application (application modules, database schemas, etc).

Types can be imported from external files or declared inside the blueprint.yaml file.

In this case we will use a type from an external URL. Since we are not really going to spawn a VM, we will use the basic type of `cloudify.types.host`. This type can get an IP of an existing host (in our case it will be the manager IP) and install the Cloudify agent on it.  We will use this functionality to simulate the hosts in our application and in order to demonstrate how Cloudify uses application agent plugins such as the bash plugin.

In order to use this type we need to add the following yaml in our blueprint file:

{%highlight yaml%}
imports:
	 - {{page.yaml_link}}

{%endhighlight%}

This file contains the declaration of the type:

{%highlight yaml%}
types:
  cloudify.types.host:
        derived_from: cloudify.types.base
        interfaces:
            cloudify.interfaces.worker_installer:
                - install: worker_installer.tasks.install
                - start: worker_installer.tasks.start
                - stop: worker_installer.tasks.stop
                - uninstall: worker_installer.tasks.uninstall
                - restart: worker_installer.tasks.restart
            cloudify.interfaces.plugin_installer:
                - install: plugin_installer.tasks.install
            cloudify.interfaces.host:
                - get_state
        properties:
            - install_agent: true
            - cloudify_agent: {}
            - ip: ''


{%endhighlight%}


The type has interfaces with operations (hooks) that are implemented using plugin functions.

Plugins are python facades for API's and tools you would like to use (such as IaaS compute API or tools like Chef and Puppet).

In this case you see 2 plugins:

- worker_installer: a manager side plugin that is responsible for SSH-ing into the host and deploying the Cloudify agent.

- plugin_installer: an agent side plugin that installs the agent plugins used in this blueprint on the current agent.

in order to use the worker_installer, we will need a private key file on our manager host (this happens as part of the manager creation process).

The `host` type also declares a configuration schema (properties that must have values). In this case it declares the install_agent with a default value of `true`, the cloudify_agent map with a default empty map and the ip propety with a default value of an empty string.

now let's add the nodejs_vm node that uses the type:

{%highlight yaml%}
    -   name: nodejs_vm
        type: cloudify.types.host
        properties:
            ip: 127.0.0.1
            cloudify_agent:
                key: /home/vagrant/.ssh/cloudify_private_key


{%endhighlight%}



The above yaml snippet specifies an anonymous yaml map with the following keys:

- name - the name of the node (in this case nodejs_host)

- type - the type of component this node is an instance-of.

- properties - the configuration of this instance.

Under properties you can see 2 key-value pairs:

- ip - in this case it is localhost as we are installing the agent on the local host - that is, only simulating another host.

- cloudify_agent - is a sub-map with the agent configuration. This is where we specify the private key path.


## Step 3: Adding a Host for MongoDB

<a href="hhttps://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-nodecellar-example/" class="btn btn-default" role="button"><i class="fa fa-search"></i>  Code Diff</a>

In a similar manner we will now add the mongod_vm node (it is a simple copy and paste with a different name):

{%highlight yaml%}
    -   name: mongod_vm
        type: cloudify.types.host
        properties:
            ip: 127.0.0.1
            cloudify_agent:
                key: /home/vagrant/.ssh/cloudify_private_key

{%endhighlight%}

## Step 4: Adding MongoDB

<a href="https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-nodecellar-example/" class="btn btn-default" role="button"><i class="fa fa-search"></i>  Code Diff</a>

Now let’s add the middleware nodes of the application. In this blueprint we are using bash types which in turn use the bash plugin to install and start the nodes.

The first node we will add is the mongod node that represents the Mongo database server. The type we will use here is cloudify.bash.db_server. This type is imported from the bash plugin types and use the bash plugin to execute scripts listed in the node configuration (under the mandatory property `scripts`).

The reason why we have specific types for db_server, app_server, etc. is that we want the user to be able to differentiate between nodes based on their role in the application. We therefore use marking types.

We need to import the bash types and plugins to use this type. The below declaration is added at the begining of the file:

{%highlight yaml%}
imports:
    - http://www.getcloudify.org/spec/bash-plugin/1.0/plugin.yaml

{%endhighlight%}


Now we can declare the mongod node:

{%highlight yaml%}
    -   name: mongod
        type: cloudify.bash.db_server
        properties:
            role: mongod
            port: 27017
            scripts:
                create: mongo-scripts/install-mongo.sh
                start: mongo-scripts/start-mongo.sh
                stop: mongo-scripts/stop-mongo.sh

{%endhighlight%}

What we see here is the scripts property which is a map of scripts mapped to lifecycle events. In this case we see that the create event is mapped to mongo-scripts/install-mongo.sh.

The scripts are uploaded with the blueprint under the subfolder mongo-scripts. The plugin has an API to fetch this file from the manager's fileserver and use it. The bash plugin knows which lifecycle event was assigned to the agent by the workflow engine and searches the scripts dictionary for the right script name and path.



## Step 5: Refining the Blueprint with a Custom Type

<a href="https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-nodecellar-example/" class="btn btn-default" role="button"><i class="fa fa-search"></i>  Code Diff</a>

We have just declared a mongod node of type cloudify.bash.db_server. This type doesn’t enforce any properties except for scripts. In the case of a mongo database we probably need to make sure the user gives us configuration details such as the role in the mongo cluster and the port on which it listens. We will therefore subtype cloudify.bash.db_server and add schema property declarations:


{%highlight yaml%}

types:
    mongo_database:
        derived_from: cloudify.types.bash.db_server
        properties:
            -   role
            -   port

{%endhighlight%}

So now our mongod node will look like this:


{%highlight yaml%}
    -   name: mongod
        type: mongo_database
        properties:
            role: mongod
            port: 27017
            scripts:
                create: mongo-scripts/install-mongo.sh
                start: mongo-scripts/start-mongo.sh
                stop: mongo-scripts/stop-mongo.sh

{%endhighlight%}

Finally we need to add the mongod relationships. This node has only one relationship - it is contained in the mongod_host node (In reality it is not in this deployment as the host is a mock)

{%highlight yaml%}
    -   name: mongod
        type: mongo_database
        properties:
            role: mongod
            port: 27017
            scripts:
                create: mongo-scripts/install-mongo.sh
                start: mongo-scripts/start-mongo.sh
                stop: mongo-scripts/stop-mongo.sh
        relationships:
            -   target: mongod_vm
                type: cloudify.relationships.contained_in

{%endhighlight%}

## Step 6: Adding nodejs

<a href="https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-nodecellar-example/" class="btn btn-default" role="button"><i class="fa fa-search"></i>  Code Diff</a>

Now we can declare the nodejs node:

{%highlight yaml%}
    -   name: nodejs
        type: cloudify.types.bash.app_server
        properties:
            scripts:
                create: nodejs-scripts/install-nodejs.sh
        relationships:
            -   type: cloudify.relationships.contained_in
                target: nodejs_vm

{%endhighlight%}

This is similar to the mongod node. It uses a bash type (cloudify.bash.app_server).
It uses the same type of relationship (cloudify.relationships.contained_in
) but it’s located in the other vm node.

## Step 7: Refining the nodejs Type

<a href="https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-nodecellar-example/" class="btn btn-default" role="button"><i class="fa fa-search"></i>  Code Diff</a>

We can refine this node as well by using a subtype in case we want specific properties in the future. The subtype will look like this:

{%highlight yaml%}
    nodejs_server:
        derived_from: cloudify.types.bash.app_server
{%endhighlight%}

as a result the final version of the nodejs node is:

{%highlight yaml%}
    -   name: nodejs
        type: nodejs_server
        properties:
            scripts:
                create: nodejs-scripts/install-nodejs.sh
        relationships:
            -   type: cloudify.relationships.contained_in
                target: nodejs_vm

{%endhighlight%}


Now let’s try and [deploy](quickstart.html) what we have created so far to get a feel of it.

## Step 8: Adding the nodejs Application Code

<a href="https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-nodecellar-example/" class="btn btn-default" role="button"><i class="fa fa-search"></i>  Code Diff</a>

we can now add the application layer by adding the nodecellar_app node. it is of type nodejs_app (which again we need to decalre inline).

{%highlight yaml%}
nodejs_app:
    derived_from: cloudify.types.bash.app_module
    properties:
        -   app_name
        -   startup_script
        -   git_url
        -   git_branch
        -   base_port
        -   num_instances
        -   env_file_path
{%endhighlight%}

And now we can add the node in the nodes list

{%highlight yaml%}
    -   name: nodecellar_app
        type: nodejs_app
        properties:
            app_name: nodecellar
            startup_script: server.js
            git_url: https://github.com/uric/nodecellar.git
            git_branch: master
            base_port: 8080
            num_instances: 1
            env_file_path: /tmp/mongo_host_and_port.sh
            scripts:
                create: nodejs-scripts/install-app.sh
                start: nodejs-scripts/start-app.sh
                stop: nodejs-scripts/stop-app.sh
        relationships:
            -   type: cloudify.relationships.contained_in
                target: nodejs

{%endhighlight%}

Again note the bash scripts used to install the application. This node has a contained_in relationship to the nodejs node which means that it will be deployed inside the node.js server
Lets [deploy](quickstart.html) again and see the entire application stack but without the db connection yet.

## Step 9: Connecting the nodejs Application to MongoDB

<a href="https://github.com/cloudify-cosmo/cloudify-nodecellar-example/" class="btn btn-default" role="button"><i class="fa fa-search"></i>  Code Diff</a>

We need to connect the node.js application to the mongo database to make it fully functional. To do so we need a plugin that will get the runtime details of the mongod node and will configure the nodecellar_app node. The plugin API gets both nodes details in the context of a relationship from the workflow engine, so it is easy to code such a plugin. In this case we are going to use a custom plugin called nodecellar_config_plugin.

This plugin is declared in the following manner:

{%highlight yaml%}
plugins:
    nodecellar_config_plugin:
        derived_from: cloudify.plugins.agent_plugin
        properties:
            folder: nodecellar-config-plugin

{%endhighlight%}

We need to add now a custom relationship that will inherit from the connected_to abstract relationship type and will use the plugin.

{%highlight yaml%}
relationships:
    nodecellar_connected_to_mongo:
        derived_from: cloudify.relationships.connected_to
        source_interfaces:
            cloudify.interfaces.relationship_lifecycle:
                - postconfigure: nodecellar_config_plugin.tasks.get_mongo_host_and_port

{%endhighlight%}


Now lets make use of this relationship in the nodecellar_app node.

{%highlight yaml%}
    -   name: nodecellar_app
        type: nodejs_app
        properties:
            app_name: nodecellar
            startup_script: server.js
            git_url: https://github.com/uric/nodecellar.git
            git_branch: master
            base_port: 8080
            num_instances: 1
            env_file_path: /tmp/mongo_host_and_port.sh
            scripts:
                create: nodejs-scripts/install-app.sh
                start: nodejs-scripts/start-app.sh
                stop: nodejs-scripts/stop-app.sh
        relationships:
            -   type: cloudify.relationships.contained_in
                target: nodejs
            -   type: nodecellar_connected_to_mongo
                target: mongod

{%endhighlight%}

# What's Next

* Now that you know how to write a basic blueprint, you can [write an Openstack blueprint]({{page.openstack_blueprint_link}}).
* Or.. you can read the [Write-a-Plugin guide]({{page.plugin_guide_link}}) to gain a better understanding of how plugins work (and write your first plugin if you like).
