						<h1><strong>NFV Management & Orchestration</strong> with TOSCA</h1>
						<p>NFV, (network function virtualization), is the growing need by Telcos and enterprises to deploy, manage and scale their network functions and services on standardized hardware. Cloudify, provides the full end-to-end lifecycle of NFV orchestration, from installation, provisioning, configuration and deployment through management and monitoring of your application or service in order for the system to take proactive actions, such as healing and scaling based on custom triggers, i.e. Day 0 through Day 2 support, all through a simple TOSCA-based YAML blueprint. </p>

				<h2><strong>Pure-Play Standard-Driven NFV Made Easy</strong></h2>
				<p>Cloudify, was built from the bottom up as an open source pure-play generic cloud orchestrator, enabling us to focus entirely on optimizing orchestration and management targeted towards NFV, being designed to integrate seamlessly with industry-embraced networking standards and modeling languages such as ETSI & MANO, YANG, NETCONF/RESTCONF, and TOSCA.  This means it is specifically geared for integration, making it possible to run any workload on any cloud environment, regardless of vendor or technology stack.</p>

				<p>Many big Telcos have chosen and are evaluating Cloudify in large part due to it being open source, as well as modular in nature, enabling pluggability with existing and new toolsets and environments. In addition to serving as the NFVO, Cloudify is also capable of fulfilling the role of VNF manager (VNFM), and has proven multi-VIM capabilities.</p>

				<p>On top of this, Cloudify provides many plugins to interface with peripheral network databases, such as DNS and LDAP, SDN controllers - ODL and more - including the full service management and chaining, and has already demonstrated its capabilities to orchestrate large subsystems like IMS, internet activation and provisioning per tenant out of the box . With the ability to have one manager that supports multiple clouds (from <a href="http://getcloudify.org/vmware-hybrid-cloud.html" target="_blank">VMware</a> to <a href="http://getcloudify.org/openstack-architecture-cloudify.html" target="_blank">OpenStack</a>) as well as multiple data centers and availability zones, Cloudify, is very attractive to mid to large Telcos, ISPs, and enterprises with a hybrid cloud model, enabling easy migration between past install-bases, and the current trendiest infrastructure including containers (see our Kubernetes example), through the next technology that hasn’t even yet landed.</p>

					<h3><b>Use Case: Data Plane Acceleration with Enhanced Platform Awareness</b></h3>

					<p>The successful adoption of NFV highly depends on the ability of a virtualized cloud infrastructure to deliver sufficient performance compared to existing proprietary network appliances. Many network functions today are I/O intensive, sending many packets of data over a short time frame, and the generic hardware prevalent among telcos and carriers is simply not equipped nor configured to handle this kind of load, or deliver the level of performance required.</p>

					<p>Advanced processor and networking technologies embedded in silicon and in PCIe devices (commonly referred to as Data Plane Acceleration) solve the hardware challenge - but only when coupled with Enhanced Platform Awareness (EPA) and Intelligent workload-aware orchestration, telco and carrier-grade NFV performance are enabled.</p>
					
					<p class="aligncenter"><img src="http://getcloudify.org/img/blog/cloudify_epa_dpa.png" width="500px"></p>

					<p>The ability of an intelligent orchestrator to perform both smart placement and configuration to be able to best leverage these capabilities, all while ensuring high availability and low latency is critical to the performance and reliability of large-scale NFV systems these days.</p>
					
					<p>Doing so on a multi-VIM environment, supporting both OpenStack and VMware stacks, enables carriers to run their mission and performance critical workloads in cloud environments without compromising performance, all the while getting simple, easy to use, service orchestration, leveraging cloud management best practices and a truly open architecture.</p>

			<h2><b>Cloudify & ETSI's MANO</b></h2>
			<p>ETSI, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, defined a standard reference architecture to achieve NFV, where an integral part of this architecture is the MANO - the NFV management and orchestration layer.</p>  
			<br/>
			<img style="float: left; display: inline" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/ETSIdiagram.png" width="550" align="left" alt="NFV | ETSI | MANO"/> 
			<p><strong>MANO based on TOSCA</strong></p>
			<p>MANO is the layer defined by ETSI that manages and orchestrates the cloud infrastructure and resources, and it is comprised of the following elements:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The VIM (Virtual Infrastructure Manager), essentially controls the interaction of the VNF with the compute, networking and storage resources of the chosen NFVI (i.e. cloud or virtualization layer).</li>
			<li>The VNFM (Virtual Network Function Manager), is responsible for the VNF lifecycle management -  e.g. it takes action on instantiation, termination, failover, scaling in and out, and more.</li>
			<li>The NFV Orchestrator (which is where Cloudify comes in), as its name implies, basically serves the purposes of orchestrating and managing the software and infrastructure resources of the VIM, and realizing the NFVI’s network services.</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p>ETSI's MANO is intended to provide the full end-to-end lifecycle of NFV orchestration and management – from installation and deployment through post-deployment, or in the telco industry terminology - Day 0 through Day 2 support.
			</p>

			<p>As MANO is currently just a guideline all implementations of MANO are proprietary, aside from the TOSCA-based agnostic implementation that also enables the plugging in of additional standards like YANG/Netconf for service chaining. </p> 

			<p>The telco industry is known to be very standard driven, therefore, the alignment with MANO is an important element for NFV adoption, where many Telcos and Enterprises these days are searching for modeling languages to help achieve the goal of application and network orchestration, and are betting on OpenStack and the nature of standards-driven open source cloud to help deliver this in the real world. This is where the importance and adoption of a standard like TOSCA becoming an important criterion in the choice of an orchestration platform.</p>

			<p>TOSCA has the combination of declarative descriptions of the application topology with all its components - including the load balancer, network, the compute resources, software and everything else, along with an imperative set of workflows to describe the logic of any process we need to automate. What this means from an NFV perspective, is that TOSCA is very good when it comes to defining virtual application topologies, VNF dependencies and relationships, actions to be performed as part of a lifecycle. This significantly simplifies the complexities involved with exposing networking elements and  end-to-end lifecycle management for NFV, by abstracting the networking piece of the deployment into an application blueprint.</p>
